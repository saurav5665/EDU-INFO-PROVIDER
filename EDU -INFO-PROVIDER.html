One of the most crucial yet confusing moments in our lives is when we are about to complete the 12th standard.   

Whether you completed your 12th a decade ago or you’re about to complete it this year, we all have gone through the same perplexion...

What to do after 12th?!

Now some of you may be thinking that it’s better to continue the stream you had taken after your 10th. Some might be thinking a way to change your stream after 12th and some may not have any clue where they want to go from here.
</p>

<p style=>Don’t worry!

In this post, we’ll be covering every possible career path you can take after you’ve completed your 12th standard. We’ll be discussing the possibilities of changing streams, pursuing the same stream courses and also what to do if you don’t know what you wish to do.

Before we get into these career paths and the options you will have to pursue as a career, it’s important to know this…

Do something you love!

This statement is thrown in conversations by many people but only because it’s important. If you’re someone who will be passing your 12th in coming months then this may sound boring but I can’t stress enough on this… Do something you love!

Because a career is a lifetime commitment, so before you choose anything, ask yourself, “Can I do this for the next 20 years of my life and not get frustrated?”.

This question is the easiest way to know whether you want to do something or not.

That being said, let’s explore the world of opportunities that lie ahead in your life!

However, most people only know about MBBS as the option to pursue their career in the field of medicine. But that’s not the case, as there are so many career paths to choose from.

If you wish to get into top medical colleges of India, then as a PCB/PCMB student, you can appear in the NEET examination. You can get good colleges if you score a good rank. NEET is the only national level entrance examination for medical students.

There are other entrances such as AIIMS & JIPMER which are conducted by individual universities.
